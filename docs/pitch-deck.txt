THE COOP REVOLUTION - PITCH DECK
==================================

Distributed. Cooperative. Digital. By design, from day one.

SLIDE 1: COVER
================================================================================

THE COOP REVOLUTION
Distributed. Cooperative. Digital. By design, from day one.


================================================================================
SLIDE 2: OPENING
================================================================================

The future of work, business, and the economy is distributed, shared, and collaborative.

But it only works if it's built that way from the root.

Not as a slogan. Not as a marketing strategy. Not as a perk.

As structure. As foundation. As DNA.

From day one.


================================================================================
SLIDE 3: THE SHIFT
================================================================================

We live in a world where most people work to build someone else's dream. Where "collaboration" is a buzzword in companies that have owners and employees. Where the value you create flows upward, not back to you.

We believe there's another way.

THE OLD MODEL                    THE COOP REVOLUTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------
You work, others profit          Those who work, build, and use are owners
Collaboration as marketing       Collaboration as structure
Centralized, with owners         Distributed, with members
Closed, proprietary              Open source, shared
Local by default                 Global and digital from the start

This isn't idealism. It's a different architecture.


================================================================================
SLIDE 4: WHAT IT IS
================================================================================

THE COOP REVOLUTION is a movement to change how we work, build, and live.

We're not here to disrupt industries. We're here to redesign the underlying structure of how people create value together.

Cooperatives and DAOs are our tools. Not the goal—the means.

Open source. Digital-first. Born global.

A network of cooperatives, connected by shared infrastructure, shared values, and a shared brand.


================================================================================
SLIDE 5: THE UPGRADE
================================================================================

Cooperatives have worked for 180 years. Democratic governance. One member, one vote. Shared ownership. Proven model.

But they got left behind. Paper-based. Local. Bureaucratic. Slow.

DAOs brought programmable governance. Smart contracts. Transparency. Global participation.

But they lack legal structure. Real-world grounding. Accessibility.

We're merging both.

COOPERATIVES          DAOs                  THE COOP REVOLUTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Legal structure       Governance on-chain   Both
One member, one vote  Smart contracts       Both
Economic participation Total transparency   Both
180 years of history  Cutting-edge tech     Both

The best of two worlds. Finally together.


================================================================================
SLIDE 6: THE COOP PROTOCOL
================================================================================

The infrastructure to create and manage cooperatives digitally.

The Coop Protocol is a cooperative itself—built to serve other cooperatives. It provides the tools, templates, and technology so anyone can launch a cooperative with modern governance from day one.

LAYER           WHAT IT DOES
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Legal           Parameterized bylaws, jurisdiction-specific compliance, open source templates
Identity        Unique digital identity for members, works across all coops in the network
Governance      Proposals, voting, quorum, automatic execution via smart contracts
Treasury        Transparent financial management, visible to all members
Registry        Immutable record of all decisions, members, and history

Tech + Legal + Brand. Integrated. Open. Evolving.


================================================================================
SLIDE 7: HOW A COOP IS BORN
================================================================================

Creating a cooperative used to take months. Lawyers. Paperwork. Bureaucracy.

With The Coop Protocol:

1. Access the Protocol — online, from anywhere
2. Configure parameters — type of coop, rules, jurisdiction
3. System generates — legal bylaws + smart contracts
4. Founders sign digitally — no paper, no cartório
5. Coop is born — with governance working from minute one

From idea to operating cooperative. Radically simplified.


================================================================================
SLIDE 8: THE FIRST WAVE
================================================================================

Five cooperatives launching together, using the Protocol:

COOPERATIVE             WHAT IT DOES
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Coop Protocol       The infrastructure layer
The Coop Bank           Digital cooperative bank
The Coop Cafe           Physical space, the movement's storefront
The Coop Edu            Scalable cooperative education
The Coop Futures        Think-tank and research

Each one independent. Each one sovereign. All connected by protocol, brand, and values.


================================================================================
SLIDE 9: THE COOP BANK
================================================================================

Imagine Nubank meets Sicredi.

A fully digital credit cooperative. No branches. No bureaucracy. Lean operation. Modern UX.

The difference: results are actually distributed to members. Not shareholders—because there are none. Members are the owners.

Transparent governance. Members vote on important decisions. Lower fees because costs are lower. Better rates because profit isn't extracted.

A bank that works for you—because you own it.


================================================================================
SLIDE 10: THE COOP CAFE
================================================================================

A coffee shop that breaks every traditional rule.

COOPERATIVE SUPPLIERS — we source from coffee cooperatives, keeping the value chain aligned.

MEMBER PRICING — members get differentiated prices on beans and drinks.

OPEN SPACE — the venue is free for community events. An experiment in freedom and autonomy.

PAY-IT-FORWARD — buy a coffee for the next person. Generosity built into the system.

SHARED RESULTS — become a member, participate in the outcomes.

The first physical storefront of the movement. Starting in Florianópolis, Brazil.


================================================================================
SLIDE 11: THE COOP EDU
================================================================================

Cooperative education for the 21st century.

The cooperative model is powerful, but nobody teaches it in a way that resonates today. Boring lectures. Outdated materials. Limited reach.

The Coop Edu changes that.

SCALABLE — online courses, apps, gamification.

MODERN — content that speaks to today's generation.

GLOBAL — English, Portuguese, Spanish. Reaching cooperatives and aspiring cooperators worldwide.

REVENUE STREAMS — courses for individuals, training for existing coops, certification programs.

What nobody else is doing. We will.


================================================================================
SLIDE 12: THE COOP FUTURES
================================================================================

The movement's think-tank.

Research on cooperativism, DAOs, distributed models, and the future of work. Deep, rigorous, cutting-edge.

PUBLISHING — reports, articles, podcasts, videos. In English, reaching global audiences.

THOUGHT LEADERSHIP — positioning The Coop Revolution as the intellectual home of the new cooperative movement.

FEEDING THE ECOSYSTEM — research becomes education (Coop Edu), informs the protocol (Coop Protocol), attracts attention and partnerships.

Ideas that move the world forward.


================================================================================
SLIDE 13: ROLES
================================================================================

How do you participate in The Coop Revolution?

ROLE            WHAT YOU DO
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Member          Formal member with voting rights, participates in governance
Worker          Works in a cooperative, usually also a member
Consumer        Uses the products and services of cooperatives
Investor        Provides capital, with rights defined by each coop's bylaws
Builder         Builds technology, products, infrastructure

One person can hold multiple roles across multiple cooperatives.

You're not locked into a box. You flow through the network based on how you want to contribute.


================================================================================
SLIDE 14: ECONOMICS
================================================================================

Every cooperative is self-sustaining.

COOP                REVENUE SOURCE
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Coop Bank       Financial services, spread, fees
The Coop Cafe       Sales, memberships, events
The Coop Edu        Courses, workshops, training
The Coop Futures    Reports, sponsorships, research grants

The Coop Protocol receives a fee from all cooperatives using its infrastructure. This funds ongoing development of tech, legal templates, and brand.

BOOTSTRAP: Founding members contribute capital. Coops generate value. Members participate in results. Grants accelerate but don't create dependency.

A flywheel: more coops → more members → stronger protocol → more coops.


================================================================================
SLIDE 15: WHO
================================================================================

GUI VIEGAS

10 years building Pulsar—a distributed organization with no owner, no leader, no hierarchy. Consulting, strategy, and education projects for companies like Sicredi, Brazil's largest credit cooperative.

Pulsar operated like a DAO before DAOs existed. Zero cost structure. Complete autonomy. Network-based entrepreneurship.

Now: channeling a decade of learning into something bigger.

Building The Coop Revolution.


================================================================================
SLIDE 16: THE ASK
================================================================================

We're looking for:

CO-FOUNDERS — People to lead the first cooperatives. Coop Bank, Coop Cafe, Coop Edu, Coop Futures.

FOUNDING MEMBERS — Believers who want in from day one. Contribute capital, participate in governance, shape the movement.

STRATEGIC PARTNERS — Legal expertise (cooperative law, international). Tech (blockchain, identity, governance). Financial (banking, compliance).

CAPITAL — To bootstrap the Protocol and first wave of cooperatives.

This isn't a startup looking for a 10x exit. This is a movement looking for committed partners.


================================================================================
SLIDE 17: WHAT'S NEXT
================================================================================

1. WHITEPAPER — Full documentation of vision, protocol, governance. Published and open.

2. FIRST COOPERATIVES — Protocol + Bank + Cafe + Edu + Futures. Legally constituted.

3. COOP CAFE OPENS — Physical presence in Florianópolis. The movement becomes tangible.

4. GLOBAL COMMUNITY — Members from anywhere, connected through the Protocol.

The revolution starts now.
