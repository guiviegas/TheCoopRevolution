# THE COOP Revolution - Documentation

## What Is This Project?

A movement to create a network of cooperatives powered by DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) technology. We're merging 180 years of cooperative history with modern programmable governance.

## The Vision

Organizations where:
- Those who work, build, and participate are the owners
- Money doesn't buy power (1 person = 1 vote)
- Everything is transparent
- Collaboration is the structure, not a slogan

## Project Components

### 1. Landing Page (`index.html`)
- Full-page scroll design
- Hero + 5 sections + CTA
- 3 languages (EN/ES/PT)
- Links to whitepaper

### 2. Whitepaper (`whitepaper.html`)
- Navigable documentation
- Sidebar navigation
- 12 sections covering the full model
- Optimized for reading

## The 9 Founding Principles (v0.1)

1. **Shared ownership** - No owner, there are owners
2. **Power can't be bought** - Governance belongs to people, not money
3. **Transparent governance** - Visible decisions, visible finances
4. **The center is empty** - DAO without owner, HQ, or CEO
5. **Sovereign cooperatives** - Autonomous, connected, never controlled
6. **Digital from the start** - Born on the internet, scales on the internet
7. **Collaboration as structure** - Distributed in the DNA
8. **Open code and knowledge** - Public goods
9. **A living experiment** - We test, learn, evolve

## The 5 Initial Cooperatives

| Coop | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Protocol** | Infrastructure, tools, templates |
| **Bank** | Cooperative financial services |
| **Cafe** | Cooperative coffee chain (physical) |
| **Edu** | Modern cooperative education |
| **Lab** | Research think-tank |

## Key Concepts

### Empty Center
The network is a DAO that doesn't govern. It guards purpose and culture. Power is distributed among cooperatives.

### COOP Token
- Soulbound (non-transferable)
- Identity and signaling
- NOT currency or voting power
- Experimental

### Cooperative Shares
- Non-transferable
- Economic participation (dividends)
- Burned on exit

### Coop-Franchising
New concept: collective brand ownership where franchisees govern the brand together.

## Roadmap

| 2 | Minimum Infrastructure | Identity, shares, governance, treasury |
| 3 | First Test Coop | Second coop, templates, inter-coop flow |
| 4 | Controlled Expansion | Bank, more coops, active token |
| 5 | Open Network | Public open source, mature templates |
| 6 | Maturity | Multiple jurisdictions, model replication |
