# The Coop Revolution — Brand Guide

## Philosophy

Distributed. Cooperative. Digital. By design, from day one.

The brand is **bold**, **minimal**, and **structural**. Like the movement itself: no fluff, no decoration, just architecture.

## Color Palette

### Primary (Black & White)

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **Black** | `#000000` | Primary text, backgrounds, bold statements |
| **White** | `#FFFFFF` | Backgrounds, reverse text, space |
| **Off-Black** | `#0A0A0A` | Softer backgrounds |
| **Off-White** | `#FAFAFA` | Softer backgrounds, cards |

### Accent (Use Sparingly)

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **Signal** | `#FF3B30` | CTAs, highlights, important actions |

The accent color should be used **rarely**—only to draw attention to critical elements. The brand lives in black and white.

## Sub-brands

Each cooperative uses the parent brand structure:

| Cooperative | Full Name | Short |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Infrastructure | The Coop Protocol | Protocol |
| Bank | The Coop Bank | Bank |
| Cafe | The Coop Cafe | Cafe |
| Education | The Coop Edu | Edu |

### Naming Convention

**The Coop [Name]**

Always "The Coop" first. Always capitalized. The sub-name follows.

## Voice & Tone

### Principles

1. **Direct** — Say what you mean. No corporate speak.
2. **Bold** — Make statements, not suggestions.
3. **Inclusive** — "We" not "the company"
4. **Grounded** — Ambitious but not hyperbolic
5. **Clear** — If it needs explanation, rewrite it

### Examples

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| "We're disrupting the future of work" | "We're changing how work works" |
| "Leverage synergies" | "Work together" |
| "Revolutionary paradigm shift" | "A different structure" |
| "Join our community!" | "Join us." |
